# Labyrinth - Zustand Project

This project is a labyrinth game app and uses the Zustand library. Fetching from an API to show players where they can navigate.

### The Problem

First, we tried to lay out what we needed and what we wanted to achieve. The next step was to take a look at the API results in Postman. We struggle to fetch 'POST' from two different URLs and connect them.
Thanks to help from a fellow boot camp student, the game finally worked. It took longer than we expected and wanted to.
